Foam glass is the future of glass recycling. It is also called cellular glass. Earlier, foam glass was manufactured by using virgin glass only. Recently, manufacturers have been using up to 98% of recycled glass to manufacture foam glass. Foam glass has a porous body, which is due to a non-toxic gas released during the production process. It is a lightweight glass material, which floats in water. Foam glass is very well suited for insulation. It also has great properties, which can resist fire. It can also retain its insulation properties even when it is wet, owing to its low water absorption and water transmission properties. It does not get affected by parasitic worms and insects.
