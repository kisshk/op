Automotive clutch is an integral part of the automotive drivetrain system that is used for power transmission between two shafts. It provides a connection and disconnection between manual transmission and engine. The engine of an automobile spins all the time, the wheel needs to be disconnected to offer synchronization between the spinning engine to the non-spinning transmission. Clutches are used to transfer power between driving shaft to the driven shaft and to disconnect the spinning engine from wheels. With the rise in automobile sales across the globe, consumer demand for efficient transmission modes and sophisticated automobiles is also increasing. Therefore, this drives the demand for automotive clutch system, which is anticipated to increase significantly over the forecast period.
